            I worked as a software engineer and web developer for several years when I was in Hong Kong. But I found that my knowledge and academic experience are insufficient, that's why in this summer, I enrolled a 2 years software engineering course in centennial college, major in artificial intelligence. because of that, I moved and lived in Toronto. I hope this is a way to strengthen my tech skills.
